# Cryptography Roadmap

## The List (Credits to SalusaSecondus)

### Courses

1. [Dan Boneh's Cryptography I](https://www.coursera.org/learn/crypto)
This is an excellent undergraduate-level course in cryptography and everyone should complete this. It should probably be your first stop
1. [Introduction to Cryptography by Christof Paar](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC1usFRN4LCMcfIV7UjHNuQg/videos)
(I haven't personally verified this one.)
I have heard good things about this series of lectures and suspect it to be similar in value to Boneh's course. So, I recommend it as well.

### Books

1. Look at [Crypto 101](https://www.crypto101.io/) by lvh. (Though I haven't personally verified it, I am very familiar with lvh's excellent work.)
1. Get [Serious Cryptography](https://nostarch.com/seriouscrypto) by Jean-Philippe Aumasson. This is one of the best books out there on applied cryptography.
1. (Just for fun) Read [The Code Book](https://www.amazon.com/dp/0385495323) by Singh. I don't think this will help you be a cryptographer, but it is a fun history of the space and light introduction to the topic. If other things here are too serious then this can be a more gentle introduction to help get you ready for the rest.
1. (Just for fun) [The Woman Who Smashed Codes](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B01M0EOI6I) by Fagone is a *fascinating* biography of Elizebeth Smith Friedman. In many ways she was the creator of modern code-breaking in the US and did much unsung work to protect the allies during both world wars.

### Activities
1. [Cryptography in Rust for Hackers](https://cryptographyinrustforhackers.com/).
1. [Cryptopals Crypto Challenges](https://cryptopals.com/)
Here is the first "hands-on" resource. It takes you through building and breaking many standard cryptographic algorithms.
It starts easy and gets *really hard* at the end. Even if you cannot complete it, you should go as far as you can and keep chipping away at it as you get better.
1. [CryptoHack](https://cryptohack.org/)
This is similar to "CryptoPals" but newer and flashier. It also looks great but I've only done portions of it.
My own real complaint is that basically requires that you work in Python and deal with network programming as well.
While neither of these are big distractions, I'm personally not a fan of Python and like being able to work offline.

### Other reading

1. [How to Learn Cryptography as a Programmer](https://soatok.blog/2020/06/10/how-to-learn-cryptography-as-a-programmer/) by Soatok
1. Read the source of the libraries you use.
1. Read *tons* of specifications. You use AES-GCM? Read [NIST SP 800-38D](https://nvlpubs.nist.gov/nistpubs/Legacy/SP/nistspecialpublication800-38d.pdf) You use HMAC? Read [RFC #2104](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc2104)
1. Read [The Stick-Figure Guide to AES](http://www.moserware.com/2009/09/stick-figure-guide-to-advanced.html)
1. Read the [Latacora Blog](https://latacora.singles/) (especially the "Right Answers")
1. Read [If You’re Typing the Letters A-E-S Into Your Code You’re Doing It Wrong](https://www.e-x-a.org/stuff/articles/typing-a-e-s/) by Thomas Ptacek

### Miscellaneous

1. Find people working in spaces closer to professional cryptography than you and ask them to help you (buy them beers or beverages of choice)
1. Look at public issues on GitHub for libraries you use and see if you can contribute, or at least understand them
1. Follow the [IACR](https://www.iacr.org/). (There are three good Twitter accounts: [official @IACRcrypto](https://twitter.com/IACRcrypto), [official @IACR_News](https://twitter.com/IACR_News), and  [unofficial @IACRePrint](https://twitter.com/IACRePrint) which follows (unreviewed) papers).) I also recommend you read my [How to read a research paper](how_to_read.md) page for help in approaching these.
1. Take a look at the [crypto subreddit wiki](https://www.reddit.com/r/crypto/wiki/index) (Excellent when I looked in May 2021.)
I especially recommend looking at the "How to get more involved section" because becoming part of the community is one of the most useful things.
Once I became part of the crypto community (back in early 2018) things became much easier for me and I started getting much better.
This is because when I had questions or was trying to figure things out,
I could easily look through the people I followed (and even ask questions) to track down the resources I needed.
1. Remember (and try to follow) any company/person mentioned in this list.
1. **KNOW YOUR LIMITS**
