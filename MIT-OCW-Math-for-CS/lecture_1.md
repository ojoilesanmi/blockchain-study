A _proof_ is a method for ascertaining the truth. An _axiom_ is a proposition that is assumed to be true.
There are counter-examples of conjectures that have been figured out.

## Examples
**Example 1:** $a^4 + b^4 + c^4 = d^4$  has no positive integer solutions.
This statement was proven to be wrong using the values:

$a = 95, 800$

$b = 217,519$

$c = 414 , 560$

$d = 422, 481$

The new statement is now: $\exists a, b, c, d \ni n^+ (n= natural positive numbers )$ .

**Example 2: Goldbach's Conjecture**

Every even positive integer but 2 is the sum of 2 primes. Example: $24 = 11 + 13$.

For conjectures like this, the reason why they are solved is to prove that they can be factorized. 
Factorizing is the way to break crypto systems like RSA which are used in several payment systems. 
All of these are based on number theory.
