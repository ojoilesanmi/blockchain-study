A proof is a method for ascertaining the truth.
There are counter-examples of conjectures that have been figured out.
For example, $a^4 + b^4 + c^4 = d^4$  has no positive integer solutions.
This statement was proven to be wrong using the values:

$a = 95, 800$

$b = 217,519$

$c = 414 , 560$

$d = 422, 481$

The new statement is now: $\exists a, b, c, d \ni n^+ (n= natural positive numbers )$ .

For conjectures like this, the reason why they are solved is to prove that they can be factorized. 
- Factorizing is the way to break crypto systems like RSA which are used in several payment systems. 
- All of these are based on number theory.
