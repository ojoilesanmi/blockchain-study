    1. Transform the plaintext into a string of bits using ASCII code
    2. Generate a random key of the same length as the plaintext
    3. Encrypt by adding modulo 2 (XOR) of the plaintext bitwise to the key and obtain the ciphertext
    4. Decrypt by making the inverse operation of adding the ciphertext to the key and obtain the plaintext again.
