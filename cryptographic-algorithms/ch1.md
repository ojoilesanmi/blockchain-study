## Fermat's Last Theorem
In number theory, no three positive integers a, b, and c satisfy the equation `a^n + b^n = c^n`
for any integer value of n greater than 2. The cases n = 1 and n = 2 have infinitely many solutions.

Clearly, from n > 3, no integer a, b, or c, verifies the sum:
```math
a^n + b^n = c^n
```
